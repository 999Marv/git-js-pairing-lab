# Intro to Git and JavaScript Pairing Lab

The purpose of this lab is to get you and your partner familiar with `git`, specifically, how to:
* Fork a repository
* `git clone` down a remote repository
* `git add` to stage and `git commit` to commit changes
* `git push` to push up commited changes from a local repo to a remote repo
* `git pull` to pull down changes from a remote repo to a local repo
* Use git to work collaboratively on a shared code base!

## Instructions

0. You will work in groups of two (no more than three) to implement various JavaScript functions.  
1. One group member, Partner A, will [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository. Only one group memebr should fork the repo. Partner B does not need to fork anything.
2. In the **forked repository**, Partner A needs to add Partner B as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). This means that both groups members will have read and write (edit) access to the forked repo. 
3. Both partners should `git clone` the forked repo to their AWS Cloud9 using SSH. 
4. Partner A will drive first with Partner B being the navigator. Partner A will implement the first function, then stage, commit, and push the changes up to the remote repo (make sure you are in the correct folder in the terminal). 
5. Double check that the remote repo on Github to ensure the latest commit was successfully pushed up. 
6. Then, it will be Partner B's turn to drive and Partner A will be the navigator. Partner B needs to `git pull` down the latest commit (make sure you are in the correct folder in the terminal). Once they the code for the first function has been pulled down, Partner B will implement the second function, then push their changes up.
7. Continue switching driver-navigator roles *for every function,* with Partner A implementing all the odd numbered questions and Partner B implementing the even numbers questions.

> Remember, paired programming means both partner are always looking at, and working off of the same screen! When you are the driver, you group should be working off your computer. And when you switch, you should be working off your partner's computer. By doing so, you will get practice with push and pull using git!

## Problems

1. Write a function `fiveToOneHundred` that console logs all numbers from 5 to 100.

2. Write a function `multiplesOfThree` that console logs all odd numbers from 1 to 50 that is a multiple of 3.
> Multiples of 3 are: `3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...`

3. Write a function ``
